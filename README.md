# ark-cn

A component registry and documentation site built on [Ark UI](https://ark-ui.com/) primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS v4, and powered by the TanStack ecosystem. Provides a shadcn-style component library with live documentation, interactive examples, and a registry endpoint compatible with the `shadcn` CLI.

---

## Overview

**ark-cn** packages headless Ark UI components into ready-to-use, copy-paste primitives — the same ownership model as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Components live in your codebase; you own them, style them, and ship them.

The site doubles as a registry API so any project can pull components directly via the `shadcn` CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @ark-cn/button
```

---

## shadcn-Style Approach

This project follows the **shadcn ownership model** — components are not installed as a package dependency. Instead, source code is copied directly into your project so you have full control.

**How it works:**

1. **No npm package** — components are not published to a registry like `npm`. You own the source.
2. **CLI-driven installation** — the `shadcn` CLI reads from the registry endpoint (`/r/{name}.json`) and writes the component file(s) into your `src/components/ui/` directory.
3. **Modify freely** — since the code lives in your repo, you can change styles, behavior, and API without forking a dependency.
4. **Ark UI as the headless layer** — accessibility, state, and interactions are handled by `@ark-ui/react`. The component files wrap Ark primitives with Tailwind classes and variant logic via `class-variance-authority`.
5. **`cn()` utility** — a `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` helper at `src/lib/utils.ts` is used throughout to compose class names safely.

**File structure per component:**

```
src/components/ui/button.tsx    ← the component you own and edit
content/docs/components/button.mdx  ← its documentation
content/ui/button.json          ← registry metadata for shadcn CLI
```

**Variants** are defined with `cva` (class-variance-authority) directly in the component file, making it easy to add, remove, or restyle variants without touching any external package.

---

## Using Components

### Via shadcn CLI (recommended)

Add any component directly to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @ark-cn/button
```

### Import

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

---

## Adding Documentation

Component documentation lives in `content/docs/components/` as MDX files. Each doc file uses a Zod-validated schema:

```mdx
---
title: Button
description: A clickable button component with multiple variants.
---

## Usage

<ComponentPreview name="button-demo" />
```

---

## Theme

The design system uses [oklch](https://oklch.com/) color space with CSS custom properties. Tokens are defined in [src/styles.css](src/styles.css) and include:

- Light / dark mode (class-based)
- Semantic color palette (background, foreground, primary, destructive, etc.)
- Sidebar and chart color scales
- Radius scale (`sm` → `4xl`)

---

## Quality Gates

Before merging, both checks must pass:

```bash
bun run type:check   # TypeScript — zero errors
bun run check        # Biome — zero lint/format issues
```

---

## Architecture Notes

- **`src/components/ui/`** — Ark UI primitives following the shadcn ownership model. These are the source of truth for component API.
- **Composition layer** (routes, docs, forms) owns loading, error, and empty states — primitives do not.
- **Content Collections** transforms MDX docs into type-safe objects available at build time.
- **Registry endpoint** at `/r/{name}.json` allows `shadcn` CLI to pull components from this registry.

For deeper architecture details see [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
